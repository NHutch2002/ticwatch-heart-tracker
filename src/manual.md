# User Manual

Once the application is running, you can make your profile by entering:
* Your Birthday
* Your Weight
* Your Gender

You can enter the settings page by clicking the icon at the bottom, where you can review or delete your profile, or delete workouts.

Clicking Start a Workout allows you to select a workout (currently only running). Clicking on this begins the Heart rate tracking and you can start exercise. Any time you stop, the watch will automatically trigger a HRR reading in the background. You can then swipe along and click “End Workout” when you’re finished and the application will report the collected metrics

Clicking on Health History will allow you to review your workout, giving the option to compare your HRR reading against other readings. You can also review multiple HRR readings here, as well as your HR range and more general Workout Metrics
